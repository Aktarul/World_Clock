# World Clock
World Clock is a desktop application that tells you about Time, Capital, UTC/GMT Standard and Currency of any country you select.

## Technologies and Tools
  1. Language: **Java**
  2. IDE: **Eclipse Mars**
  3. Builder: **Eclipse WindowBuilder**
 
## Advantages and Limitations
This is an offline application. So you do not need any internet connection. 
As it is implemented based on Bangladesh (GMT+6), so it takes the system time and changes it to other country's time comparing Bangladesh. As a result if you use this application in other country then time will be incorrect but others information will be provided correctly.
